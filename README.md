# ROR-RSPEC
Hero, Enemies and Weapons - Request and Model testing with RSPEC/ROR

Hello guys! Thats just a repository with some examples of usage of RSPEC at Ruby on Rails.
At these examples I'm testing Model and Request behaviors using some classes like: "Hero, Weapon and Enemy".
That's just for fun and the purpose of learning more and more.

See you!

Best
Ian
